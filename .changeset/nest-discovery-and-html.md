Correct dependency discovery for NestJS and other script/config-driven projects: separate tooling and required peers from possibly unused packages, group lockstep and peer-coupled upgrades, count imported value references, hide zero-count symbols, show major-version gaps, and omit workspace columns in single-package repositories.

Add `uptide list --html [--open]` using check's report template and styling, with group check commands, copy buttons and collapsed tooling/possibly-unused sections. Reports exclude source code and local paths by default; `--details` adds file lists. Add a synthetic single-package pnpm NestJS regression fixture.

Add scope/lead-package group names and `check --group` expansion, peer member labels, width-aware terminal columns and details-only symbols. Share an offline light/dark report design between list and check with one command per group, responsive rows and private default output. Read the installed CLI version for report headers, including when a package is versioned after bundling.
